# DualContouringCSharp
A Dual Contouring Example using C# and Unity3D

The unity package can be imported into unity and run. The code portion of this has everything set up, but you need to manually add the game manager script into the scene you're using. 

Also, please do not use this code as the "Ideal way to code in C#"!!! It is by no means optimized for managed code. This is nothing but a direct port of NGildea's Dual Contouring Impl from his blog.
